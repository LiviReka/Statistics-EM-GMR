# stats-mix-regression
Mixture of regressions project

1) Create synthetic dataset
2) Work on math and code an EM algorithm
3) Numerical tests
4) Independence


### Some background info/notes
- EM (expectation maximization) algorithm computes the probability of each point belonging to one of n distributions, if we are starting with a mixed distribution model
- answers this question: How likely is point Xi to come from distribution A? (vs distribution B)
